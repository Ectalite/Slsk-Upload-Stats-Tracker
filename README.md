# User stats

From the user stats page you can view all the users who have downloaded from you. 
For each user the program logs all their downloads and sorts them by folder.
There are a few different sorting options and a search bar. The search works on anything in the 
whole database (username, folder, filename etc). You can remove any item from the database by selecting it and clicking
the "Remove Selected" button.

Anything you select in the database (users, folders, or files) will show stats and information on the selected
item in the top right. Tracked stats are things like: number of times a folder or file has been downloaded, last user to download a folder,
added up total size in kilobytes of a users downloads, and much more.
